we have to run the de bugger and find this out
something is happening here

switch the variables
issue-it skips 0. It's skipping two seprate values



if reset the N it still runs.
N is not nesscary to declare

comment alittle more so you can have an idea of what you did
perhaps your tracking something and waht to mutlipte the statement then you ca us or and (and)
 
python reads code line by line
make sure you can come up with your own solutions

without the a has not problem take thjat value and resend it to another variable to mulinupulate


string - characters in a format

a gentic for loop never has to generate

implement your wild loop
 
study type of number and what it is.


z=7
for x in [3,7,8]
z = z*x
Print(n)

if your ever having trouble with logic. Just put print z you would get the vlaue of z
print z tell you the value of n 
not wrting any code

multiple choice
in/int= int
int/float = float
float/float = float

if I try to add a string to an int that would would be in the print line( a straight sentence)
int-interger

the wheel and the order things go study waterfall an all the other methodlogies
